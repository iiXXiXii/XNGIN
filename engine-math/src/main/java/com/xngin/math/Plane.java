 * Represents a plane in 3D space, defined by a normal vector and a distance from the origin.
 * This class is used for various geometric calculations such as frustum culling,
 * reflection, and collision detection. It provides methods for computing the
 * distance from a point to the plane and determining which side of the plane a point is on.
