/**
 * Represents physical material properties for physics bodies.
 * This class defines surface properties such as friction, restitution (bounciness),
 * density, and other material characteristics that affect how bodies interact
 * during collisions and contact. It provides presets for common materials
 * and supports custom material definitions.
