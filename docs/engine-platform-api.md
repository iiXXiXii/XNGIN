# Engine Platform API Module Documentation

The `engine-platform-api` module defines the abstract interfaces for platform-specific features in XNGIN. This includes window management, input handling, timing, and other system-level services. By abstracting these features, the engine can support multiple platforms and implementations.

---

## Responsibilities

- **Window Management**: Declares interfaces for creating, displaying, and managing application windows.
- **Input Handling**: Provides abstract interfaces for keyboard, mouse, and other input devices.
- **Timing and System Services**: Offers access to timers, clipboard, and other platform utilities.
- **Backend Independence**: Enables different platform implementations (e.g., LWJGL, future backends) to be plugged in seamlessly.

---

## Key Concepts

### Window Abstraction
- Create and manage windows with configurable properties (size, title, fullscreen, etc.).
- Handle window events (resize, close, focus, etc.).

### Input Abstraction
- Unified interfaces for querying input device states.
- Event-driven input for responsive applications.

### System Services
- Access to high-resolution timers, clipboard, and other OS features.

## Example Usage

```java
import com.xngin.platform.Window;

Window window = Window.create("My Game", 1280, 720);
window.show();
```

---

## Extending the Module

- Implement new platform backends by providing concrete classes for the API interfaces.
- Integrate with input, rendering, and audio modules for a complete platform solution.
- Add support for new system services as needed.
