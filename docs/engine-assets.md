# Engine Assets Module Documentation

The `engine-assets` module is responsible for asset management within XNGIN. It provides facilities for loading, caching, and hot-reloading resources such as textures, models, audio files, and other game data.

---

## Responsibilities

- **Asset Loading**: Supports loading assets from the file system, classpath, or other sources.
- **Caching**: Efficiently caches loaded assets to avoid redundant loading and improve performance.
- **Hot-Reloading**: Monitors asset files for changes and reloads them at runtime, enabling rapid iteration during development.
- **Resource Management**: Ensures proper disposal and management of asset memory and handles.

---

## Key Concepts

### Asset Types
- Textures (images, sprites)
- Models (meshes, animations)
- Audio files (sound effects, music)
- Custom data (configuration files, scripts, etc.)

### Asset Loaders
- Pluggable system for supporting new asset types.
- Each loader implements a common interface for consistency.

### Caching and Hot-Reloading
- Assets are cached after first load for fast access.
- File watchers detect changes and trigger reloads automatically (if enabled).

---

## Example Usage

```java
import com.xngin.assets.AssetManager;

AssetManager assets = new AssetManager();
Texture texture = assets.load("textures/player.png", Texture.class);
```

---

## Extending the Module

- Implement new asset loaders for custom file types.
- Integrate with the engine's event system to notify other modules of asset changes.
- Ensure thread safety and efficient resource management.
