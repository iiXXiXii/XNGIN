# Engine Physics Dyn4j Module Documentation

The `engine-physics-dyn4j` module integrates the Dyn4j 2D physics engine with XNGIN. It implements the interfaces defined in `engine-physics-api`, providing robust, real-time physics simulation for games and applications.

---

## Responsibilities

- **Dyn4j Integration**: Implements physics simulation using the Dyn4j library.
- **Collision Detection and Response**: Handles collisions, contacts, and physical responses between bodies.
- **Rigid Body Dynamics**: Supports mass, velocity, forces, and constraints for realistic movement.
- **Event Handling**: Provides hooks for collision and trigger events, enabling game logic integration.

---

## Key Concepts

### Physics World
- Manages all physics bodies, shapes, and constraints.
- Steps the simulation forward in fixed time increments.

### Bodies and Fixtures
- Rigid bodies with properties such as mass, velocity, and damping.
- Fixtures define the shape and physical properties of each body.

### Events and Callbacks
- Collision and trigger events for responding to contacts and overlaps.
- Custom event listeners for game-specific logic.

## Example Usage

```java
import com.xngin.physics.dyn4j.Dyn4jPhysicsWorld;

Dyn4jPhysicsWorld world = new Dyn4jPhysicsWorld();
world.createBody(...);
world.step(1.0f / 60.0f); // Advance simulation
```

## Extending the Module

- Add support for new shapes, joints, or constraints as needed.
- Integrate with the scene and input modules for interactive simulations.
- Optimise for specific game requirements or performance needs.
