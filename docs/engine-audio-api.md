# Engine Audio API Module Documentation

The `engine-audio-api` module defines the abstract interfaces for audio playback and management in XNGIN. It enables the engine to support multiple audio backends and provides a consistent API for sound and music features.

---

## Responsibilities

- **Audio Abstraction**: Declares interfaces for audio playback, streaming, and control.
- **Backend Independence**: Allows different audio implementations (e.g., OpenAL, future backends) to be plugged in seamlessly.
- **Sound and Music Management**: Supports playing, pausing, stopping, and looping of sound effects and music tracks.
- **Volume and Panning**: Provides control over volume, balance, and spatial positioning.

---

## Key Concepts

### Audio Sources
- Sound effects (short, often repeated sounds)
- Music tracks (longer, streamed audio)

### Audio Control
- Play, pause, stop, loop
- Adjust volume and panning
- Query playback state

### Extensibility
- Implement new audio backends by providing concrete classes for the API interfaces.
- Integrate with the asset module for loading audio files.

## Example Usage

```java
import com.xngin.audio.AudioManager;

AudioManager audio = AudioManager.getInstance();
audio.playSound("sounds/jump.wav");
audio.playMusic("music/theme.ogg", true); // Loop music
```
