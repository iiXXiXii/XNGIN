# Engine Physics API Module Documentation

The `engine-physics-api` module provides the abstract interfaces for physics simulation in XNGIN. It enables the engine to support multiple physics backends and offers a consistent API for collision detection, rigid body dynamics, and related features.

---

## Responsibilities

- **Physics Abstraction**: Declares interfaces for physics worlds, bodies, shapes, and collision events.
- **Backend Independence**: Allows different physics implementations (e.g., Dyn4j, future engines) to be integrated seamlessly.
- **Simulation Control**: Supports stepping the simulation, querying state, and managing physics objects.
- **Event Handling**: Provides hooks for collision and trigger events.

---

## Key Concepts

### Physics World
- Manages all physics bodies and constraints.
- Steps the simulation forward in time.

### Bodies and Shapes
- Rigid bodies with properties such as mass, velocity, and damping.
- Shapes for collision detection (e.g., box, circle, polygon).

### Events
- Collision events for responding to contacts between bodies.
- Trigger events for sensors and area detection.

## Example Usage

```java
import com.xngin.physics.PhysicsWorld;
import com.xngin.physics.Body;

PhysicsWorld world = new PhysicsWorld();
Body player = world.createBody();
player.setPosition(0, 0);
player.setVelocity(1, 0);
world.step(1.0f / 60.0f); // Advance simulation
```

## Extending the Module

- Implement new physics backends by providing concrete classes for the API interfaces.
- Integrate with the scene and input modules for interactive simulations.
- Add support for new shapes or constraints as needed.
