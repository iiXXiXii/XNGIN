# Engine Renderer API Module Documentation

The `engine-renderer-api` module defines the abstract interfaces for rendering in XNGIN. It enables the engine to support multiple rendering backends (such as Vulkan and OpenGL) and provides a consistent API for drawing graphics, managing resources, and handling rendering pipelines.

---

## Responsibilities

- **Rendering Abstraction**: Declares interfaces for rendering contexts, command buffers, pipelines, and resources (textures, buffers, shaders).
- **Backend Independence**: Allows different rendering implementations (e.g., Vulkan, OpenGL) to be plugged in seamlessly.
- **Resource Management**: Manages GPU resources and synchronisation.
- **Draw Calls and Pipelines**: Provides methods for submitting draw calls and configuring rendering pipelines.

---

## Key Concepts

### Rendering Context
- Represents the state and resources required for rendering.
- Manages framebuffers, swapchains, and synchronisation.

### Command Buffers
- Encapsulate rendering commands for efficient submission to the GPU.

### Pipelines
- Define how graphics are processed and rendered (shaders, states, etc.).

### Resources
- Textures, vertex/index buffers, uniform buffers, and shaders.

---

## Example Usage

```java
import com.xngin.renderer.Renderer;

Renderer renderer = Renderer.getInstance();
renderer.beginFrame();
renderer.draw(mesh, material, transform);
renderer.endFrame();
```

---

## Extending the Module

- Implement new rendering backends by providing concrete classes for the API interfaces.
- Add support for new resource types or pipeline features as needed.
- Integrate with the scene and asset modules for a complete rendering solution.
