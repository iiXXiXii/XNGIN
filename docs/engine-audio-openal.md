# Engine Audio OpenAL Module Documentation

The `engine-audio-openal` module provides an OpenAL-based audio backend for XNGIN, using LWJGL for Java bindings. This module implements the interfaces defined in `engine-audio-api` and delivers robust, cross-platform audio playback for games and applications.

---

## Responsibilities

- **OpenAL Integration**: Implements audio playback and management using the OpenAL API via LWJGL.
- **Resource Management**: Manages audio buffers, sources, and streaming for sound effects and music.
- **3D Audio Support**: Enables spatial audio, allowing sounds to be positioned and moved in 3D space.
- **Performance and Compatibility**: Designed for low-latency playback and broad hardware support.

---

## Key Concepts

### OpenAL Context
- Initialises and manages the OpenAL context and device.
- Handles resource allocation and cleanup.

### Audio Buffers and Sources
- Loads audio data into buffers for playback.
- Controls playback state, looping, and spatial properties via sources.

### 3D Audio
- Positions sounds in 3D space relative to the listener.
- Supports Doppler effect, attenuation, and directional audio.

## Example Usage

```java
import com.xngin.audio.openal.OpenALAudioManager;

OpenALAudioManager audio = new OpenALAudioManager();
audio.initialise();
audio.playSound("sounds/explosion.wav");
audio.setListenerPosition(0, 0, 0);
```

---

## Extending the Module

- Add support for new audio formats or streaming techniques as needed.
- Integrate with the asset and scene modules for dynamic audio control.
- Optimise for specific hardware or use cases.
