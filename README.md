## Architecture Overview

XNGIN's modular design ensures that each component has a clear, well-defined purpose whilst working seamlessly with the rest of the system. This approach makes the engine both powerful and maintainable.

### Core Engine Modules

**Engine Core** (`engine-core`)
The central nervous system that coordinates all other modules, manages the application lifecycle, and provides essential services like logging, configuration, and the main game loop.

**Mathematics** (`engine-math`)
High-performance mathematical foundations including vectors, matrices, quaternions, and geometric operations optimised for graphics and physics calculations.

**Asset Management** (`engine-assets`)
Intelligent asset pipeline supporting multiple file formats, automatic caching, hot-reloading during development, and efficient memory management.

**Scene Management** (`engine-scene`)
Flexible scene graph implementation with a powerful entity-component-system architecture for organising and managing game objects.

### Platform Integration

**Platform API** (`engine-platform-api`)
Cross-platform interface definitions for windowing, input handling, file system access, and other system-level services.

**LWJGL Implementation** (`engine-platform-lwjgl`)
Robust desktop implementation using LWJGL, providing window management, input handling, and native library integration.

### Graphics & Rendering

**Renderer API** (`engine-renderer-api`)
Hardware-agnostic rendering interfaces that abstract away graphics API complexity whilst maintaining performance.

**OpenGL Backend** (`engine-renderer-gl`)
Mature OpenGL implementation offering broad compatibility and excellent development experience.

**Vulkan Backend** (`engine-renderer-vk`)
High-performance Vulkan implementation for applications requiring maximum graphics performance and control.

### Audio System

**Audio API** (`engine-audio-api`)
Platform-independent audio interfaces supporting positional audio, environmental effects, and efficient audio resource management.

**OpenAL Implementation** (`engine-audio-openal`)
3D audio implementation using OpenAL, providing spatial audio capabilities and cross-platform audio processing.

### Physics Integration

**Physics API** (`engine-physics-api`)
Flexible physics system abstractions supporting multiple physics engine backends and custom physics implementations.

**Dyn4j Integration** (`engine-physics-dyn4j`)
Sophisticated 2D physics implementation using the Dyn4j library, offering advanced collision detection and realistic dynamics.

### Input Handling

**Input System** (`engine-input`)
Unified input abstraction supporting keyboard, mouse, and extensible device integration with customisable input mapping.

### Application Framework

**Game Launcher** (`game-launcher`)
Complete application entry point demonstrating proper engine integration and serving as a starting template for new projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java 24** or later (we embrace the latest language features for better performance and cleaner code)
- **Gradle** 8.0+ (included via wrapper, so no separate installation required)

### Building the Engine

Clone the repository and build everything:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iiXXiXii/XNGIN.git
cd XNGIN
./gradlew build
```

### Running the Demo

See XNGIN in action with the demonstration launcher:

```bash
./gradlew :game-launcher:run
```

### Development Mode

For active development with automatic rebuilding:

```bash
./gradlew build --continuous
```

## Creating Your First Game

### Basic Project Setup

1. **Create your game module** with standard Java project structure
2. **Configure dependencies** in your `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(project(":engine-core"))
    implementation(project(":engine-platform-lwjgl"))
    implementation(project(":engine-renderer-gl"))
    // Add other modules as needed
}
```

3. **Implement your game class**:

```java
import com.xngin.Engine;
import com.xngin.Game;

public class MyGame extends Game {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Engine engine = new Engine();
        engine.run(new MyGame());
    }

    @Override
    public void initialise() {
        // Set up your game world
    }

    @Override
    public void update(float deltaTime) {
        // Update game logic
    }
}
```

### Example: Simple Scene Setup

```java
import com.xngin.scene.Scene;
import com.xngin.scene.Entity;
import com.xngin.scene.components.TransformComponent;
import com.xngin.scene.components.MeshRendererComponent;

Scene gameScene = new Scene();
Entity player = gameScene.createEntity("Player");

player.addComponent(new TransformComponent());
player.addComponent(new MeshRendererComponent());
```

## Technology Foundation

XNGIN builds upon carefully selected, industry-proven technologies:

**Core Libraries:**

- **LWJGL 3** - Comprehensive native bindings for graphics, audio, and platform services
- **JOML** - High-performance Java mathematics library optimised for graphics programming
- **Dyn4j** - Robust 2D physics engine with advanced collision detection capabilities

## Development & Extension

### Adding Custom Modules

XNGIN's architecture encourages extension and customisation:

1. **Create a new module directory** (e.g., `my-custom-module/`)
2. **Add to `settings.gradle.kts`** to include in the build process
3. **Define clean interfaces** in API modules, implement in separate modules
4. **Use Java's `ServiceLoader`** for runtime discovery and loose coupling

### Best Practices

- **Follow the API/Implementation pattern** - separate interfaces from concrete implementations
- **Write comprehensive tests** for all functionality
- **Use the event system** for cross-module communication
- **Consult the documentation** in `docs/` for architectural guidance

### Contributing

We welcome contributions that enhance XNGIN's capabilities and usability:

1. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch from `main`
2. **Develop your enhancement** following established coding standards
3. **Write thorough tests** ensuring compatibility with existing functionality
4. **Update documentation** for new APIs or significant changes
5. **Submit a pull request** with clear descriptions of improvements

For detailed contribution guidelines, see [docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Testing & Quality Assurance

Comprehensive testing ensures XNGIN's reliability:

**Run all tests:**

```bash
./gradlew test
```

**Test specific modules:**

```bash
./gradlew :engine-core:test
./gradlew :engine-renderer-vk:test
```

**Continuous testing during development:**

```bash
./gradlew test --continuous
```

Each module maintains comprehensive test coverage including unit tests, integration tests, and performance benchmarks.
